Our EOH exhibit will consist of a laptop attached to our captive portal (we will be using a wired router
for our captive portal as wireless networks are discouraged in Siebel center as they may interfere with
the existing networks). Our captive portal will operate just as an airport wireless network would, blocking
all ports except 53/udp (DNS), and only allowing DNS connections to itself.<br />
<br />
We will <i>not</i> be demonstrating the tunnel on the University portal.

<br />
<b>Our exhibit won 2nd place in the "Original Undergraduate Research" category!</b><br />
