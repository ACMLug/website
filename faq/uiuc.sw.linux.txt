  1.  UIUC Linux Basics

  1.1.  What is Linux?

  Linux is a free UNIX(tm)-like operating system developed by a loosely-
  knit team of programmers all around the world.  Originally created in
  1991 by Linus Torvalds, it contains all the features you would expect
  from a modern fully-fledged UNIX, including preemptive multitasking,
  multi-threading, symmetric multiprocessing, virtual memory, shared
  libraries, demand paging, shared copy-on-write executables, advanced
  memory management, and one of the fastest TCP/IP network stacks
  available.

  It is distributed under the GNU General Public License.


  1.2.  Is Linux UNIX?

  Technically, no.  UNIX is a registered trademark of the X/Open Company
  Ltd., and Linux cannot be called UNIX without permission from them.
  Furthermore, Linux is not based off of any of the source code from the
  original versions of UNIX, unlike the free BSD variants. However, you
  will probably find that many, if not most, of the standard UNIX
  applications are available under Linux; quite often porting software
  to Linux simply requires little more than a recompile.



  1.3.  Why should I use Linux?

  Linux is a technically advanced, Open Source(tm), UNIX-like operating
  system.  It is stable, efficient, and runs on many different
  architectures. Many pieces of software, including the Linux kernel
  itself, can be obtained free of  charge over the Internet.  It is
  especially popular as a server, providing services such as DNS, NIS,
  HTTP, NFS, and SMB (Windows(tm) file and printer sharing), and as a
  high-power low-cost workstation.


  1.4.  What is a distribution?

  Linux, in general, usually refers to the kernel of the operating
  system.  Many other components are necessary for the use of a
  computer, such as applications, libraries, configuration files,
  startup files, etc.  Distributions, such as Red Hat, Debian, SuSE,
  Slackware, Stampede, and Caldera, package all these components
  together with the Linux kernel and provide mechanisms for its
  installation.  Each distribution has its own "personality" and is
  tailored towards a certain group of people.

  A more complete list of distributions is available at
  http://www.linuxhq.com/dist-index.html.


  1.5.  What distribution do you recommend?

  There is no one "best" distribution.  For beginners, we often
  recommend Red Hat or SuSE; for slightly more advanced users, we also
  recommend Debian.  Try as many different distributions out as you can;
  soon you will find which appeals to you the most.


  1.6.  How do I install Linux?

  After deciding on a distribution, you can usually install Linux using
  a number of different methods, including CD-ROM, floppy, FTP, NFS, and
  another partition on your hard drive.  This method is highly dependent
  on the distribution, and we recommend that you visit your chosen
  distribution's web site and follow their instructions.


  1.7.  What about FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD?

  These are other excellent, free UNIX-like operating systems available
  for many different architectures.  They have slightly different feels
  than Linux, but many run Linux binaries.  They also have a less
  restrictive license, allowing redistribution without releasing the
  source code.  We encourage you to try them out as well.

  Please visit http://www.freebsd.org, http://www.openbsd.org, or
  http://www.netbsd.org.


  1.8.  What is LUG?

  LUG refers to the UIUC Linux Users' Group.  We usually meet at 8pm on
  Tuesdays in 1102 DCL.  Feel free to drop in with questions, comments,
  or simply to talk about what's new with Linux; new members are always
  welcome.  Our web page is http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/lug/.





  1.9.  What is Encap?

  From the UIUC Encap Home Page:

  "Encaps" are precompiled, easily installable packages in a format that
  makes software maintenance very easy. Encaps of many public domain
  utilities are available for most major operating systems.


  1.10.  What is X?

  X, otherwise known as the X Window System or X11, is a network
  transparent window system which runs on a wide range of computing and
  graphics machines.  It is also architecture-independent, so you can
  remotely run an application from a Sun to your Linux box (for
  example).  The version of X that usually comes with Linux is called
  XFree86.


  2.  Installation and Booting

  2.1.  How can I dual boot Windows 9x and Linux?

  Please see the Linux+Win95 HOWTO at
  http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/mini/Linux+Win95.html.


  2.2.  How can I dual boot Windows NT(tm) and Linux?

  If you plan on using LILO as your primary bootloader, the instructions
  should be nearly exactly the  same as in "How do I dual boot Windows
  9x and Linux?"  If you plan on using the NT bootloader, please see the
  Linux+NT-Loader HOWTO at
  http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/mini/Linux+NT-Loader.html.


  3.  Command Line and Administration

  3.1.  How can I list all the files in the current directory except for
  . and ..?

  If you are using GNU ls, then ls -A will do it.  Otherwise, use the
  regular expression "* .[^.]* ..?*".


  3.2.  How do I set environment variables under sh derivatives (sh,
  bash, zsh, etc)?

  To set environment variables in the Bourne-derived shells, use the
  export command, as in:

  export VARIABLE=value

  Place this in the proper dot-file for your shell (.profile, .bashrc,
  .zshrc, .zshenv, etc).


  3.3.  How do I set environment variables under csh derivatives (csh,
  tcsh)?

  The C-Shell uses a different syntax than the Bourne shells, and so you
  will need to use setenv, as in:

  setenv VARIABLE value


  Again, place this in the proper dot-file for your shell (.chsrc,
  .login, etc)


  3.4.  How can I set my time from an atomic clock?

  From a posting to uiuc.sw.linux by Mark Roth,

  First obtain the package xntp.  Then run "ntpdate ntp.uiuc.edu" once
  on bootup, and run xntpd to keep the clock synced.  Put "server
  ntp.uiuc.edu" in /etc/ntp.conf so xntpd knows where to get its time
  information.


  3.5.  Why should I use ssh instead of telnet or rsh?

  Traditionally, telnet and rsh do not encrypt their connections.
  Therefore, anybody who can access a computer between yours and the
  destination could easily grab your password if you use those
  utilities.  Ssh protects against this attack, along with IP spoofing,
  IP source routing, DNS spoofing, and X attacks based on X
  authentication data.  Furthermore, ssh automatically sets up X
  forwarding for you; there is no need to mess with xhost or xauth.

  To learn more about ssh, visit the ssh FAQ.


  3.6.  How do I upgrade my kernel?

  Please see the Kernel HOWTO at
  http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html.


  4.  The X Window System

  4.1.  How do I configure X?

  If you are running Red Hat, you can try the command Xconfigurator.
  Otherwise, try using the program XF86Setup (a graphical configuration
  program that uses TCL/TK).  Since XF86Setup does not exist everywhere,
  xf86config, a command-line tool, can also be used to configure your X
  setup.

  Alternatively, you can edit your XF86Config (which is usually in /etc/
  or /etc/X11/) with your favorite text editor.


  4.2.  How do I upgrade X?

  If you are using a distribution such as Red Hat or Debian, we
  recommend that you look for the appropriate packages and upgrade using
  that method.  Specifically, the Red Hat packages can probably be found
  at ftp://updates.redhat.com.  If you want to compile the source code
  yourself, please look for the packages at ftp://ftp.xfree86.org or a
  mirror.


  4.3.  What is a window manager?

  A window manager is the program that determines how things like window
  borders, icons, and menus are drawn.  By changing the window manager
  you can make your desktop look like nearly anything you want.  For
  example, there are window managers that emulate the look and feel of
  Windows 95, the Macintosh(tm), NeXT(tm), etc.


  4.4.  Which window manager do you recommend?

  Window Maker is a very popular window manager that has a NeXT-like
  interface.  Other popular window managers include Enlightenment, FVWM,
  IceWM, and AfterStep.  Like distributions, no one window manager is
  the "best" for everyone.  Information about many different window
  managers, with screenshots, is available at
  http://www.plig.org/~xwinman/.


  4.5.  How do I run X at a different color depth?

  The easiest way to do this is to start X by using "startx -- -bpp 16"
  where 16 is the color depth you wish to run.  Alternatively, you can
  manually edit the startx script to always use this color depth, or
  manipulate your XF86Config (which is usually in /etc/ or /etc/X11/) by
  removing all references to other color depths.  For example, the
  relevant section in my XF86Config looks like:



       Section "Screen"
           Driver      "accel"
           Device      "Matrox Millennium II 4MB"
           Monitor     "Gateway2000 Vivitron 17"
           Subsection "Display"
               Depth       16
               Modes       "1152x864" "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480" "640x400"
           EndSubsection
       EndSection




  Be sure to back up your XF86Config before attempting modifications.


  4.6.  How do I remotely run X applications?

  If you use ssh, everything should already be set up.  Otherwise, a
  quick tutorial on xauth will tell you something like:



       localmachine > xauth list | grep localmachine
       localmachine:0 MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 102384102398410923841023481234
       ... other stuff ...
       localmachine > telnet remotemachine
       remotemachine > xauth add localmachine:0 MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 102384102398410923841023481234
       remotemachine > export DISPLAY=localmachine:0




  That's all there is to it.  Of course, if you are using csh or tcsh,
  you will have to use setenv instead of export.

  More information is available at
  http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/workshops/security/x.html.


  4.7.  XDM is ugly.  What can I replace it with?

  Some popular alternatives include kdm, gdm, login.app, and wdm.


  4.8.  What are X resources?

  X maintains a global, network-aware resource database that is often
  referred to as the X resource database.  Items are added to this
  database using the xrdb command, usually from files with names like
  Xdefaults and Xresources. X resources are used by most X programs for
  their configuration, and allow extreme levels of customization.
  However, learning how to manipulate them is somewhat intimidating.

  An example of a small .Xresources file:



       rxvt.background:   Black
       rxvt.foreground:   AntiqueWhite
       rxvt.cursorColor:  Red3
       rxvt.font:         fixed




  Look into the commands xrdb and editres to find out how to manipulate
  X resources.


  4.9.  Why should I use xauth instead of xhost?

  If you use xhost to remotely display X applications, then you are
  leaving yourself wide open to easy X session hijacking, password
  grabbing, and the like.  This is because the line "xhost +hostname"
  allows anybody at the computer named "hostname" to access your X
  session.  "xhost +" allows anybody in the world access to your X
  session -- a very bad thing indeed.

  Xauth is much better than xhost because it requires the attacker to
  exert more effort to compromise security.  By creating a passcode, and
  using that passcode on the remote computer to access your X session,
  you are preventing people who don't know the passcode from getting at
  your machine.  Of course, if the connection to the remote computer is
  unencrypted, they could conceivably steal the passcode.  However,
  that's the least of your worries in that case.

  More information is available at
  http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/workshops/security/x.html.


  4.10.  How do I get my IntelliMouse(tm) wheel to work in X?

  For a PS/2 mouse:

  First, you'll need to edit your XF86Config file (in /etc or /etc/X11)
  to set the Protocol in the Pointer section to IMPS/2 [1].  Now, go to
  http://solaris1.mysolution.com/~jcatki/imwheel/ and download the
  imwheel package.  Follow the installation instructions, and the wheel
  should now work.  Note that the same procedure is used for Logitech
  wheel mice, too.

  [1] Here's the Pointer section of XF86Config after following the
  instructions for installing imwheel.







  Section "Pointer"
     Protocol        "IMPS/2"
     Device          "/dev/psaux"
     BaudRate        1200
     ZAxisMapping    4 5
     Buttons         3
  EndSection





  5.  Desktop Environments

  5.1.  What are GNOME and KDE?

  GNOME and KDE aim to be fully-functional, integrated desktop
  environments.  They consist of a number of different programs that all
  look and act similarly, and can be customized in a common way.  GNOME
  can be found at http://www.gnome.org/, and KDE can be found at
  http://www.kde.org/.


  5.2.  Are GNOME and KDE window managers?

  No, they are not.  GNOME and KDE work with a number of different
  window managers, and encompass much more than the simple manipulation
  of windows.  However, each one of them recommends a window manager
  that "works best."  For GNOME, the recommended window manager is
  Enlightenment, and for KDE it is the included KWM.  Other window
  managers, such as Window Maker, integrate well with both GNOME and
  KDE.


  5.3.  Which of GNOME and KDE do you recommend?

  As of this writing, KDE seems to be further ahead in terms of end-user
  ease of use and installation, while GNOME has numerous technical
  merits.  Try both out and find which appeals to you more.


  6.  Linux Applications

  6.1.  Why are my Netscape buttons black and white?

  This problem seems to be specific to certain color depths.  Try
  changing your color depth to a different value.


  6.2.  Where can I find information about filtering mail using proc-
  mail?

  Visit Joe Gross's excellent procmail tutorial at
  http://www.stimpy.net/procmail/tutorial/.


  6.3.  Is ICQ available for linux?

  Yes!  There are numerous clones available (not to mention Mirabilis'
  java version, which is not very good).  See
  http://www.portup.com/~gyandl/icq/.





  6.4.  Is there a Netmeeting compatible program for Linux?

  Netmeeting uses H.323 for audio conferencing, and there is work to
  develop a free implementation at Open H.323. They have some
  source/binaries available, and people have used them to successfully
  talk to NetMeeting 3.0. Unfortunately, Microsoft used a proprietary
  system for the video.


  6.5.  What word processors are available for Linux?

  Word Perfect, Star Office, ApplixWare, LyX, KOffice.


  6.6.  What spreadsheets are available for Linux?

  Star Office, ApplixWare, KOffice, Gnumeric.


  6.7.  Where can I look for other applications?

  A good starting point is either http://freshmeat.net/ or
  http://www.linuxapps.com/.


  7.  UIUC-Specific Information

  7.1.  How do I run Mentor Graphics remotely?

  The primary problem in getting Mentor Graphics to work remotely seems
  to be having the right fonts installed.  To get the right fonts, you
  must run the mgc_font_collect script on a machine that has Mentor
  Graphics installed, and then copy these fonts to your computer and add
  them to your X font database.


  7.2.  How can I use my Linux machine as my primary e-mail machine?

  Surprisingly this is pretty straight-forward. In Redhat, there is
  almost no dreaded sendmail hackery to be done. First off, if you don't
  have a static IP, you're going to be SOL, and you're going to have to
  settle for using fetchmail or POP and changing your FROM address in
  your mail client. In which case, refer to those questions in this FAQ.

  If you do have a static IP address, and have a registered domain name
  (note, this is probably only possible if you live in private housing.
  In which case you can usually request a static IP), then all you have
  to do is edit /etc/sendmail.cw and on a line by itself, put in the
  domainname that points to your static IP address, then restart
  sendmail (something along the lines of /etc/rc.d/init.d/sendmail
  restart for System V style inits).



  7.3.  How can I change my from header in e-mails?

  Cool mail clients first: in Mutt, simply add

  my_hdr From: someuser@somewhere.net (Some Name)

  to .muttrc. In Pine, you can set the hostname of the from field but
  apparently not much else. Go to (S)etup, then (C)onfig, then edit the
  second field down.  In Netscape you may specify the whole email
  address under Edit->Prefrences->Identity.
