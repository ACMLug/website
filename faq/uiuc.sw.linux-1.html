<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 What is Linux?</A>
</H2>

<P>Linux is a free UNIX(tm)-like operating system developed by a loosely-knit
team of programmers all around the world.  Originally created in 1991 by 
Linus Torvalds, it contains all the features you would expect from a
modern fully-fledged UNIX, including preemptive multitasking,
multi-threading, symmetric multiprocessing, virtual memory, shared libraries,
demand paging, shared copy-on-write executables, advanced memory management,
and one of the fastest TCP/IP network stacks available.
<P>It is distributed under the GNU General Public License.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Is Linux UNIX?</A>
</H2>

<P>Technically, no.  UNIX is a registered trademark of the X/Open Company
Ltd., and Linux cannot be called UNIX without permission from them.
Furthermore, Linux is not based off of any of the source code from the 
original versions of UNIX, unlike the free BSD variants. However, you
will probably find that many, if not most, of the standard UNIX
applications are available under Linux; quite often porting software to
Linux simply requires little more than a recompile.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 Why should I use Linux?</A>
</H2>

<P>Linux is a technically advanced, Open Source(tm), UNIX-like operating
system.  It is stable, efficient, and runs on many different
architectures. Many pieces of software, including the Linux kernel
itself, can be obtained free of  charge over the Internet.  It is
especially popular as a server, providing services such as DNS, NIS,
HTTP, NFS, and SMB (Windows(tm) file and printer sharing), and as a
high-power low-cost workstation.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.4">1.4 What is a distribution?</A>
</H2>

<P>Linux, in general, usually refers to the kernel of the operating
system.  Many other components are necessary for the use of a computer,
such as applications, libraries, configuration files, startup files,
etc.  Distributions, such as
<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A>,
SuSE,
<A HREF="http://www.slackware.org/">Slackware</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.stampede.org/">Stampede</A>, 
and Caldera, package all these components together with the Linux kernel
and provide mechanisms for its installation.  Each distribution has its
own "personality" and is tailored towards a certain group of people.
<P>A more complete list of distributions is available at 
<A HREF="http://www.linuxhq.com/dist-index.html">http://www.linuxhq.com/dist-index.html</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.5">1.5 What distribution do you recommend?</A>
</H2>

<P>There is no one "best" distribution.  For beginners, we often recommend
Red Hat or SuSE; for slightly more advanced users, we also recommend
Debian.  Try as many different distributions out as you can; soon you
will find which appeals to you the most.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.6">1.6 How do I install Linux?</A>
</H2>

<P>After deciding on a distribution, you can usually install Linux using a
number of different methods, including CD-ROM, floppy, FTP, NFS, and
another partition on your hard drive.  This method is highly dependent
on the distribution, and we recommend that you visit your chosen
distribution's web site and follow their instructions.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.7">1.7 What about FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD?</A>
</H2>

<P>These are other excellent, free UNIX-like operating systems available
for many different architectures.  They have slightly different feels
than Linux, but many run Linux binaries.  They also have a less
restrictive license, allowing redistribution without releasing the
source code.  We encourage you to try them out as well.
<P>Please visit

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.8">1.8 What is LUG?</A>
</H2>

<P>LUG refers to the UIUC Linux Users' Group.  We usually meet at 8pm on
Tuesdays in 1102 DCL.  Feel free to drop in with questions,
comments, or simply to talk about what's new with Linux; new members
are always welcome.  Our web page is

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.9">1.9 What is Encap?</A>
</H2>

<P>From the 
<A HREF="http://www-wsg.cso.uiuc.edu/encap/">UIUC Encap Home Page</A>:
<P>"Encaps" are precompiled, easily installable packages in a format that
makes software maintenance very easy. Encaps of many public domain
utilities are available for most major operating systems.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.10">1.10 What is X?</A>
</H2>

<P>X, otherwise known as the X Window System or X11, is a network
transparent window system which runs on a wide range of computing
and graphics machines.  It is also architecture-independent, so you can
remotely run an application from a Sun to your Linux box (for example).
The version of X that usually comes with Linux is called
