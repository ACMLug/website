<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 How do I run Mentor Graphics remotely?</A>
</H2>

<P>The primary problem in getting Mentor Graphics to work remotely seems to 
be having the right fonts installed.  To get the right fonts, you must
run the mgc_font_collect script on a machine that has Mentor Graphics
installed, and then copy these fonts to your computer and add them to
your X font database.

<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 How can I use my Linux machine as my primary e-mail machine?</A>
</H2>

<P>Surprisingly this is pretty straight-forward. In Redhat, there is almost no
dreaded sendmail hackery to be done. First off, if you don't have a static IP,
you're going to be SOL, and you're going to have to settle for using
fetchmail or POP and changing your FROM address in your mail client. In which 
case, refer to those questions in this FAQ.
<P>If you do have a static IP address, and have a registered domain name (note,
this is probably only possible if you live in private housing. In which case
you can usually request a static IP), then all you have to do is edit
/etc/sendmail.cw and on a line by itself, put in the domainname that points to
your static IP address, then restart sendmail (something along the lines of
/etc/rc.d/init.d/sendmail restart for System V style inits).

<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3 How can I change my from header in e-mails?</A>
</H2>

<P>Cool mail clients first: in Mutt, simply add 
<P>my_hdr From: someuser@somewhere.net (Some Name)
<P>to .muttrc. In Pine, you can set the hostname of the from field but apparently
not much else. Go to (S)etup, then (C)onfig, then edit the second field down. 
In Netscape you may specify the whole email address under
Edit->Prefrences->Identity.
