<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 What are GNOME and KDE?</A>
</H2>

<P>GNOME and KDE aim to be fully-functional, integrated desktop
environments.  They consist of a number of different programs that all
look and act similarly, and can be customized in a common way.  GNOME
can be found at 
<A HREF="http://www.gnome.org/">http://www.gnome.org/</A>, and KDE can be found at 
<A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">http://www.kde.org/</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Are GNOME and KDE window managers?</A>
</H2>

<P>No, they are not.  GNOME and KDE work with a number of different window
managers, and encompass much more than the simple manipulation of
windows.  However, each one of them recommends a window manager that
"works best."  For GNOME, the recommended window manager is 
<A HREF="http://www.enlightenment.org/">Enlightenment</A>, and for KDE
it is the included KWM.  Other window managers, such as 
<A HREF="http://www.windowmaker.org">Window Maker</A>, integrate well
with both GNOME and KDE.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 Which of GNOME and KDE do you recommend?</A>
</H2>

<P>As of this writing, KDE seems to be further ahead in terms of end-user
ease of use and installation, while GNOME has numerous technical
merits.  Try both out and find which appeals to you more.
