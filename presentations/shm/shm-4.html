<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Writing a malloc debugger</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Concepts</A>
</H2>

<P>So right now we know that we can map memory into our process at an
address we specify, and we can also set permissions on this memory
using mprotect. Furthermore, we know that mapped memory is not
actually allocated by the system until it is faulted (or accessed 
in some way). We can use these facts to create a simple malloc
debugger.
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Goals</A>
</H2>

<P>Basically we want to protect against the most common memory usuage 
errors using various combinations of mmap and mprotect so that when
programs make these errors, they exit immediately with a <CODE>SEGV</CODE>
instead of continuing to produce bizzare and (seemingly) unrelated 
side effects.
<H3>Overflows &amp; Underflows</H3>

<P>The most common errors in programming with dynamic memory are buffer
overflows (writing past the end of an allocated segment), and 
underflows (writing in the memory before an allocated segment).
<P>Here we take advantage of our little friend <CODE>mprotect()</CODE>
So, essentially all we need to do is mark a page of memory ajoining
the valid allocated memory with no access permissions. However, since
we can only set permissions on entire pages of memory (and these pages
must occur at multiples of the page size) we can only prevent buffer 
overflows or underflows, but not both. 
<H3>Using free'd memory</H3>

<P>A third common mistake in programming is trying to acess already freed
memory. We can prevent this easily enough by unmapping a
<CODE>free()</CODE>'d region, and mapping that same address and length to 
/dev/zero with no permissions set. Note this shouldn't cause any 
memory leak, because the kernel should dispose of the 
<CODE>unmap()</CODE>'ed pages, yet should not allocate any of the new 
pages until the program faults them (and will subsequently seg fault 
anyways).
<H3>Derefrencing NULL</H3>

<P>Here we can do the same concept for free'd memory, except for the
address 0. Namely, we map a single page of no access memory to 
address zero, so that if any application tries to dereference a 
NULL pointer, it automatically segfaults. (Note that in normal
operation, dereferencing and reading address 0 is undefined yet valid, 
but writing to address 0 will usually segfault).
