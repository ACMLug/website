<H3>Mapping Files</H3>

<P>When you request a shared segment under the BSD implementation,
what you are really doing is requesting that a file (actually, a
file descriptor 'fd', which was already opened by <CODE>open(2)</CODE>) of length
'length' be mapped into the address pointed to by 'start' of your 
proceess space starting 'offset' bytes into the file. If start is
NULL, the address is determined by the kernel. NOTE: You MUST know
the length of the file being mapped (see <CODE>fstat(2)</CODE>), and the length 
of your segment WILL NOT CHANGE from this initial length. This means
if write past the end of the segment, the file will not be appened
to. You will get a segmentation fault instead. 
<P>The kernel then instructs the MMU of the CPU to
generate a "page fault" when a section of this region of memory 
is accessed. When the kernel gets this page fault, it gets a page
(4K) of data from the corresponding location in the file, and reads
it into memory. The kernel only does this once per page of data in
your mapped segment. This also means that no physical memory is
allocated untill you start accessing the pages of the mapped region.
<H3>Pemissions and access</H3>

<P>The standard file modes are checked by the kernel to determine
whether or not a process has access to map a file (shared or not).
In addition, you may also specify permissions on the segment itself.
These permissions describe to the kernel what may be done to the
actual memory (Can it be executed? Can it be read? Written to?) The
<CODE>mprotect</CODE> system call can be used to change permissions on 
any section of previously mapped memory that starts on a page 
boundry.
<P>When an attempted mmap to a file fails, mmap returns -1 (not NULL!), 
and errno is set. However, when you try to access a segment in a way
that violates its permissions, a segmentation fault is generated. 
<H3>Syncronization</H3>

<P>When you write to a your shared segment, your changes do not appear
immediately to the file until you perform an <CODE>msync(2)</CODE>. They 
are, of course, visible to other processes who also are sharing your
segment.
<P>Additionaly, you may make the segment private, which means that if
another process maps the file, it does not see changes to your 
version of the mapped file, and vice versa. Another characteristic 
that might be confused with a private mapping is an anonymous 
mapping. Anonymous mappings are not associated with files at all, 
and hence are not shared memory. We will use them to implement our 
malloc debugger however. (Note anonymous mappings are not POSIX
standard. However, most UNIX flavors do support it. Those that don't 
usually allow multiple mappings to /dev/zero of any length.)
