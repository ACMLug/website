<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 What is Shared Memory?</A>
</H2>

<P>Shared memory (SHM) is another method of interprocess
communication (IPC) whereby 2 or more processes share a single chunk
of memory to communicate. The shared memory system can also be used to
set permissions on memory, allowing for things like malloc debuggers
to be written.
<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Types of Shared memory available</A>
</H2>

<P>Basically there are two different types of shared memory available for
most flavors of UNIX. As you may have guessed, each of the two orignal
ancestors of modern UNIX have their own implementation, altough almost
all modern UNIX flavors implement both. The names of the respective
implementations are System V IPC, and BSD mmap.
<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 General Principles</A>
</H2>

<P>Basically using shared memory under both systems will involve the
following:
<H3>Uniquely naming the segment.</H3>

<P>Each implementation has a 
method establishing a system wide unique name for each 
segment so that other applications may access it. Both also
have methods of procuring private (or "anonymous") segments. 
<H3>Specifying access permissions.</H3>

<P>Both implementations allow you to specify access using
the traditional read/write/execute scheme.
<H3>Race conditions.</H3>

<P>Dealing with race conditions varies under each system.
What they do have in common is that race conditions do 
occurr in each :)
