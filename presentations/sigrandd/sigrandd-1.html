<P>NOTE: Many examples and explanations in this article were taken
from <CODE>Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment</CODE> by W.
Richard Stevens, (c) 1992.
<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Named Pipes (FIFOs)</A>
</H2>

<P>FIFOs, sometimes called named pipes, are an UNIX interprocess
communication mechanism that is a standard part of POSIX.1.
While standard pipes can only be used between related
processes when a common ancestor has created the pipe, FIFOs
allow unrelated processes to exchange data.  A FIFO is
actually a type of file, and the standard file I/O functions
(<CODE>open</CODE>, <CODE>close</CODE>, <CODE>read</CODE>, <CODE>write</CODE>,
<CODE>unlink</CODE>, etc.) all work with FIFOs.
<P>As you will see, using a FIFO for your <CODE>.signature</CODE> file
instantly allows every application access to a randomly created
<CODE>.signature</CODE>, without requiring modifications to the
individual applications.  To them, your <CODE>.signature</CODE> file
looks and acts just like a regular text file.
<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Basic Strategy for Writing a Signature Randomizer</A>
</H2>

<P>Since FIFOs look and act just like regular files, we can
create a randomized <CODE>.signature</CODE> by simply making
<CODE>.signature</CODE> into a FIFO and having a process deliver
data to it upon request.  To do this, we can write a daemon that
will live "forever" and constantly tries to send a new, random
signature to the FIFO.
