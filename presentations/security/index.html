<h1>Securing your Linux Installation</h1><br>
<ul>
<li>Securing your system:
<ul>
<li>tcp-wrappers
<ul>
<li>/etc/hosts.deny</li>
<li>/etc/hosts.allow</li>
<li>Format for entries: <code>daemon_list : client_list [ : shell_command ]</li>
</ul></li>
<li>services in /etc/inetd.conf
<ul>
<li>What you don't need:
<ul>
<li>Any of the rhost services (rsh, rlogin, rexec, etc).  If you want this functionality in a secure setting, use <a href="ftp://ftp.cs.hut.fi/pub/ssh/">ssh</a></li>
<li>finger</li>
<li>tftpd, bootps -- normally only used for net-booting other machines
<li>For any service that you don't understand, it's safe to turn that service off 99% of the time (at the very least, turn it off long enough to learn what it is, and then decide whether to turn it back on or not)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What you might want:
<ul>
<li>telnetd</li>
<li>ftpd</li>
<li>identd</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>standalone services
<ul>
<li>These services are found in /etc/rc.d/init.d, and linked into the proper runlevels in /etc/rc.d</li>
<li>If you don't need or want a service, remove the S* link to that service in the relevant runlevel.  For example, if there is a script /etc/rc.d/init.d/sendmail that starts sendmail, and  that script is linked into runlevel 3 as /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S20sendmail, then to turn off sendmail, simply remove that link.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>To firewall or not to firewall</li>
